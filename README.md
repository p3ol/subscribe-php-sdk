## Sandbox mode

You can use the sandbox mode to test your integration without any real payment.
Pass the `sandbox: true` request option (last parameter) to any method of the SDK to use it:

```javascript
$client->offers->list(1, 10, [], [], 'active', ['sandbox' => true]);
```

## Migrations

## v1 to v2

- `customers.switchSubscriptionOffer(customerId, subscriptionId, offer, requestOptions)` becomes `customers.switchSubscriptionOffer(customerId, subscriptionId, offer, **{ priceId }**, requestOptions)` -> it now takes an additional parameter before request options to speficy offer options like price id
- `sandbox: true|false` is now an option on every request (instead of only offers list) and has been removed from `offers.list()`
- `offers.list(page, count, status, include, exclude)` becomes `offers.list(page, count, include, exclude, **status**, requestOptions)` -> it is moved to the end of the parameters list to be consistent with other SDKs.
